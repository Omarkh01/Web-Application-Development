			<h2>Our Mission</h2>

			<p> Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of
				directors.
				Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform,
				educate, and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us: </p>

			<blockquote>&quot;Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift
				of
				knowledge...and that is priceless.&quot;</blockquote>
